## What is MyTime

MyTime is a time and project task management application.

MyTime allows the user to manage and record the time they spend in project related tasks and activities and create sharable timesheet.

## Planning

For the Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project only a part of the MyTime application would be developed.

The application should focus on the technologies and tools discussed in the course material.

The emphasis should be on the simple interactive functions and features.

MyTime application at this phase should focus on the core functions - namely the time recorder for task management.

## UX / UI

The user interface should be intuitive and simple to use. The application is meant for mobile devices. On desktops the window size should limited, so the application can be used together with other applications, for example with text programs or internet, without the MyTime application taking too much of space on viewport.  

### User Stories

1. Students
    - MyTime helps the students to track their time use when studying

2. Self employed
    - MyTime allows tracking time in different project tasks and can be used to produce a timesheet  
    - The time sheet can be send to an employer or used for administration

3. Small businesses working with hour based employees working on company premise or from home
    - the employees can use MyTime to plan tasks and share registration of the used time for different tasks

## Functions and features

At this point, the application contains only the core user functions and related features.
The application explores MVP requirements for eventually more complete time management application featuring more functions and customization options:  
    - The future functions and features will allow the user customizations of projects and tasks, customization of viewing features and sharing options and administration/ user interactions.  
    - The application would also feature a login portal for users and administrators and access to two separate user environments.  
    - The application would allow creating, saving and working with multiple projects.
