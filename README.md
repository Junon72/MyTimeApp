## What is MyTime

MyTime is a time and project task management application.

MyTime allows the user to manage and record the time they spend in project related tasks and activities and create sharable timesheet.

## Planning

For the Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project only a part of the MyTime application would be developed.

The application should focus on the technologies and tools discussed in the course material.

The emphasis should be on the simple interactive functions and features.

MyTime application at this phase should focus on the core functions - namely the time recorder for task management.

## UX / UI

The user interface should be intuitive and simple to use. The application is meant for mobile devices. On desktops the window size should limited, so the application can be used together with other applications, for example with text programs or internet, without the MyTime application taking too much of space on viewport.  

### User Stories

1. Students
    - MyTime helps the students to track their time use when studying and plan better their time use.  


    _"As a 'Student', I want to keep track on time I use for studying separate subjects, and make sure I take enough breaks, so I can maintain concentration without loosing time"._    
    

    _"As a "Student", I want to learn to know better my own habits, so I can change the habits that are distracting or hindering my development."_  


2. Self employed
    - MyTime allows tracking time in different project tasks and can be used to produce a timesheet.  
    - The time sheet can be send to an employer or used for administration.  

3. Small businesses working with hour based employees working on company premise or from home.  
    - the employees can use MyTime to plan tasks and share registration of the used time for different tasks.  

4. Anybody interested in where does the time actually go.

## Functions and features

At this point, the application contains only the core user functions and related features.
The application explores MVP requirements for eventually more complete time management application featuring more functions and customization options:  
    - The future functions and features will allow the user customizations of projects and tasks, customization of viewing features and sharing options and administration/ user interactions.  
    - The application would also feature a login portal for users and administrators and access to two separate user environments.  
    - The application would allow creating, saving and working with multiple projects.

### MyTime core functions  

The application consists of seven pages - from creating a project to sharing and exiting the project.  
For this Milestone project I have focused on the first part of the applications features, namely creating the project and tasks. The data is also saved to the local storage for later use, for example to create dynamic elements on following pages.  
Unlike the starting pages, the rest of the interfaces are not interactive. However, they give an impression of the planned user experience and flow.  

### Realized functions

1. Creating projects.  
    - user can create a project.  
2. Creating project tasks.
    - user can create new tasks for the project.  
    - user can delete tasks.

### Planned functions

1. Recording time spend in tasks.
    - user can record time spend in each task.
    - user can pause recording and continue recording.
2. Viewing the time record.
    - user can view the time record of individual tasks.
    - user can view the time record of working on the project.
3. Sharing the record.
    - user can share the time record by email.  

Eventually it would be possible to create multiple projects, each with their own tasks and option to delete, duplicate and modify them.

### MyTime core features and requirements (realized functions)

- user interactions and application responses.

## Deployment

The application was created using VSCode (Visual Studio Code) IDE. Local Git Repository was initialized through VSCode to hold version control repository, and used in parallel with GitHub. GitHub was used also for deployment of the application. Gitpod helped to communicate code related questions towards the tutors.  

Deployment:

- after selecting the repository in Github Dashboard navigate to _"Settings"_.
- scroll down the settings page to _"GitHub Pages"_ sections.
- in the list of drop menu, which can be accessed by clicking the button, under the title _"Source"_, select _"Master Branch"_ .
- the page will refresh automatically, and a message should appear  at the top of the GitHub Pages section, announcing the site is ready to be published, with a link to the website.
- the application can be also run via Gitpod
